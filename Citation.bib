abstract = {Reversible watermarking enables the embedding of useful information in a host signal without any loss of host infor- mation. Tian's difference-expansion technique is a high-capacity, reversible method for data embedding. However, the method suf- fers from undesirable distortion at low embedding capacities and lack of capacity control due to the need for embedding a location map.We propose a histogram shifting technique as an alternative to embedding the location map. The proposed technique improves the distortion performance at low embedding capacities and mit- igates the capacity control problem. We also propose a reversible data-embedding technique called prediction-error expansion. This new technique better exploits the correlation inherent in the neigh- borhood of a pixel than the difference-expansion scheme. Predic- tion-error expansion and histogram shifting combine to form an effective method for data embedding. The experimental results for many standard test images show that prediction-error expansion doubles the maximum embedding capacity when compared to dif- ference expansion. There is also a significant improvement in the quality of the watermarked image, especially at moderate embed- ding capacities. Index},
